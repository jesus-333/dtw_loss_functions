    For each combination of batch size, signal length and number of channels specified in the input lists, compute the loss for each loss function specified in ``loss_functions_to_use``.
    
    The ``loss_functions_to_use`` is a dictionary where the keys are the names of the loss functions and the values are the instances of the loss functions to test.
    The loss functions must be instances of the classes implemented in this package.

    The results are saved in npy files at the path ``{path_save}/{loss_function_name}/``. The ``loss_function_name`` is the key of the loss function in the ``loss_functions_to_use`` dictionary.
    Each file will be name as ``B_{batch_size}_T_{signal_length}_C_{num_channels}.npy`` and will contain a numpy array of shape (n_repetitions,) with the computed loss values for each repetition.

            Size of the markers in the plot.
        - linewidth : int, default 2
            Line width for the lines in the plot.
        - y_scale_log : bool, default False
            Whether to use a logarithmic scale for the y-axis.
        - y_lim : tuple, default None

        - use_milliseconds : bool, default False
            Whether to use milliseconds instead of seconds for the computation times. If True, the computation times will be multiplied by 1000 and the y-axis label will be updated accordingly.
        - path_save : str, default 'benchmark/plot.png'
            If specified, the plot will be saved at the given path. If None, or not specified, the plot will not be saved.

        If provided, the standard deviation will be plotted as shaded area around the mean values. The default value is None, which means that the standard deviation will not be plotted.
    color_dict : list, optional
        Dictionary containing the colors to use for each label. The keys of the dictionary should be the same as the labels in the ``labels_to_plot`` list.
        The values should be valid color specifications for matplotlib (e.g. 'red', '#FF0000', etc.).
        If not provided, the default color cycle of matplotlib will be used. The default value is None.

    Returns
    -------
    fig : matplotlib.figure.Figure
        Figure object containing the plot.
    ax : matplotlib.axes.Axes
        Axes object containing the plot.
